# Dynamic Pricing Model for Local Events & Experiences

## Project Overview
This project develops a dynamic pricing algorithm for local events (concerts, workshops, tours) based on real-time demand, competitor prices, and user sentiment, helping event organizers optimize revenue.

## Objectives
- Create data scrapers for event listings and pricing information
- Develop demand estimation models using search trends and sentiment analysis
- Build a machine learning-based dynamic pricing model
- Create a simulation environment to test pricing strategies
- Develop an interactive dashboard for visualizing insights

## Key Tasks
1. **Data Research**: Scrape event listings, ticket prices, and availability from platforms like Eventbrite, Meetup, and local ticketing sites
2. **Demand Estimation**: Use web search trends (Google Trends API), social media mentions, and sentiment from reviews to estimate demand fluctuations
3. **Pricing Model**: Build machine learning models (regression, reinforcement learning) to suggest price adjustments dynamically
4. **Simulation**: Create a pricing simulation environment to test strategy impact on attendance and revenue
5. **Dashboard**: Build interactive dashboards showing demand trends, price elasticity, and suggested prices for organizers

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: requests, BeautifulSoup, Selenium, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch (optional)
- **APIs**: Google Trends, Twitter API
- **Dashboard**: Streamlit or Power BI Desktop
- **Environment**: Jupyter, GitHub

## Deliverables
- Data scraper and preprocessor scripts
- Dynamic pricing model and simulation
- Dashboard to visualize insights and recommendations
- Documentation with setup instructions and model explanation
