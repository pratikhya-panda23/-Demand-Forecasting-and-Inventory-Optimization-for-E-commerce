Data Science 2 - Dynamic Pricing Model for Local Events & Experiences
Dynamic Pricing Model for Local Events & Experiences
Objective
Develop a dynamic pricing algorithm for local events (concerts, workshops, tours) based on real-time demand, competitor prices, and user sentiment, helping event organizers optimize revenue.
Key Tasks
Data Research: Scrape event listings, ticket prices, and availability from platforms like Eventbrite, Meetup, and local ticketing sites
Demand Estimation: Use web search trends (Google Trends API), social media mentions, and sentiment from reviews to estimate demand fluctuations
Pricing Model: Build machine learning models (regression, reinforcement learning) to suggest price adjustments dynamically
Simulation: Create a pricing simulation environment to test strategy impact on attendance and revenue
Dashboard: Build interactive dashboards showing demand trends, price elasticity, and suggested prices for organizers
Data Collection
Web scraping (BeautifulSoup, Selenium) for event and ticket data
Google Trends API for demand signals
Social media API or public review data for sentiment analysis
Tools
Python: requests, BeautifulSoup, Selenium, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch (optional)
APIs: Google Trends, Twitter API
Dashboard: Streamlit or Power BI Desktop
Environment: Jupyter, GitHub
Deliverables
Data scraper and preprocessor scripts
Dynamic pricing model and simulation
Dashboard to visualize insights and recommendations
Documentation with setup instructions and model explanation
